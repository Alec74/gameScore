  ## Description

One day I couldn't find a peice of paper when trying to play rummy 500 so I wanted to make a paperless solution. The aim was to make an app that can work for card games as well as any other score based game. [Webpage](https://alec74.github.io/gameScore/)

* The user is able to save their current game in local storage
* The user is able to resume their previously saved game
* The user can add or subtract scores from individual players
